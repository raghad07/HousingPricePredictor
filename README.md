# HousingPricePredictor

This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project. The project focuses on predicting housing prices using a dataset that includes various features such as housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, and ocean proximity.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available in the file "housing.csv". It contains information about housing properties in a specific area. The dataset includes 20,640 rows and 8 columns, with each row representing a different housing property. The columns in the dataset include:

Housing Median Age: The median age of the houses in the area.
Total Rooms: The total number of rooms in a housing property.
Total Bedrooms: The total number of bedrooms in a housing property.
Population: The population count in the area.
Households: The number of households in the area.
Median Income: The median income of the residents in the area.
Median House Value: The median value of houses in the area.
Ocean Proximity: The proximity of the housing property to the ocean.

# Preprocessing

Before applying machine learning algorithms, some preprocessing steps were performed on the dataset. These steps include:

Dropping unnecessary columns: The longitude and latitude columns were dropped from the dataset.
Handling missing values: The missing values in the "total_bedrooms" column were filled with the mean value of the column.
Converting categorical data: The "ocean_proximity" column, which contains categorical data, was converted into numerical values for modeling purposes.
Modeling

The dataset was split into input features (X) and target variable (y). The X matrix includes the selected columns from the dataset, and the y vector represents the median house value. The dataset was then normalized using standard scaling.

Various machine learning algorithms were explored to predict housing prices. Some of the algorithms used include linear regression, K-nearest neighbors, decision tree, support vector machines, and ensemble methods.

# Evaluation

The performance of the machine learning models was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score. The models were trained on a training set (80% of the data) and tested on a separate testing set (20% of the data) to assess their generalization ability.

# Results and Conclusion

The results of the machine learning models are summarized, highlighting the performance of each algorithm in predicting housing prices. The best-performing model and its corresponding evaluation metrics are mentioned.

Overall, this project demonstrates the application of various machine learning algorithms for predicting housing prices based on a given set of features. It provides insights into data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation techniques. The code and resources in this repository can serve as a reference for similar machine learning projects in the future.
